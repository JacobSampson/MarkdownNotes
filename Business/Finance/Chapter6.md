# Discounted Cash Flow Valuation

## Future Value and Compounding



## Present Value and Discounting

### Discounted Cash Flow

- Assume cash flows are
  - Intermediate between present and future
  - Coincident with compounding periods


$$
P=\sum \frac {C_i} {{(1 + r)}^i}
$$

**Pure Discount Loan**

- Treasury bills
  - Principal amount is repaid at some future date without periodic interest payments

**Interest Only Loan**

**Perpetuity**

**Growing Perpetuity**

- $g$ is annual rate of growth

$$
\frac {C_1} {r - g}
$$

**Annuity**
$$
C = \frac {P*r} {1 - \frac 1 {(1 + r)^N}}
$$

$$
P = \frac C r (1 - \frac 1 {(1 + r)^N})
$$

**Growing Annuity**
$$
P = \frac C {r - g} [1 - (\frac {1 + g} { 1 + r})^N]
$$
**Periodic Amortizing Loan**
$$
C = \frac {P*r} {1 - \frac 1 {(1 + r)^N}}
$$

$$
P = \frac C r (1 - \frac 1 {(1 + r)^N})
$$
