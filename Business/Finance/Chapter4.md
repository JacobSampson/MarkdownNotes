# Financial Planning

## Forecast Financial Statements

Sales forecast: many cash flows depend directly on the level of sales (estimated using sales growth rate)

Asset requirements: additional assets that will be required to meet sales projections

Financial requirements: amount of financing needed to pay for the required assets

Plug variables: management deciding what type of financing will be used

### Pro Forma

Pro forma statements: setting up the plan using projected financial statements allows for consistency and ease of interpretation

### Percentage of sales method

1. Start with a sales forecast
2. Identify key financial ratios to guide forecast
   - Percent increase in sales
   - Target ratios
   - Constant ratios
   - Industry average ratios

### Income Statements

Costs may vary directly with sales - profit margin is constant

Depreciation and interest expense do not vary directly with sales - profit margin is not constant

*Dividends are a management division and generally do not vary directly with sales*

### Balance Sheet

- Initially assume all assets, excluding fixed, vary directly with sales
- Accounts payable will also normally vary with sales
- Notes payable, long-term debt, and equity do no vary with sales
- Change in retained earnings portion of equity will come from the dividend decision

Plowback ratio = Additions to retained earnings / Net profit

Payout ratio = 1 - Plowback ratio



Debt-to-equity **Include Accounts Payable??**

## Growth and Funding

External financing needed (EFN)

- Pro forma sheets are used to predict needed capital
- The option with the cheapest cost of capital is considered



### Critical Growth Rates

- Low growth levels may allow for financing from retained earnings



- Internal growth rate
  - $(ROA * b) / (1 - ROA * b)$
  - No external financing
  - *b* is plowback ratio
- Sustainable growth rate
  - $(ROE*b)/(1-ROE*b)$
  - No external equity financing while maintaining a constant debt-to-equity ratio

### Financial Policy

Planning horizon: The long-range time period on which the financial planning process
focuses (usually the next two to five years)



The firm’s needed investment in new assets: This will arise from the
investment opportunities the firm chooses to undertake, and it is the
result of the firm’s capital budgeting decisions.
The degree of financial leverage the firm chooses to employ: This will
determine the amount of borrowing the firm will use to finance its
investments in real assets. This is the firm’s capital structure policy.
The amount of cash the firm thinks is necessary and appropriate to pay
shareholders: This is the firm’s dividend policy.
The amount of liquidity and working capital the firm needs on an
ongoing basis: This is the firm’s net working capital decision.



#### Ability to Sustain Growth

Profit margin: An increase in profit margin will increase the firm’s
ability to generate funds internally and thereby increase its sustainable
growth.
Dividend policy: A decrease in the percentage of net income paid out as
dividends will increase the retention ratio. This increases internally
generated equity and thus increases sustainable growth.
Financial policy: An increase in the debt-equity ratio increases the
firm’s financial leverage. Because this makes additional debt financing
available, it increases the sustainable growth rate.
Total asset turnover: An increase in the firm’s total asset turnover
increases the sales generated for each dollar in assets. This decreases the
firm’s need for new assets as sales grow and thereby increases the
sustainable growth rate. Notice that increasing total asset turnover is the
same thing as decreasing capital intensity.
