# Stock Valuation

**Cash Flows for Stockholders**

- Dividends
  - Dividend income

- Sell shares
  - Capital gains income



Firm Value = Debt Value + Equity Value

- *Market value is usually not radically different from the book value*



**Cash Flows to Equity**

Dividends = (1 - b) NP

Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) = EBIT (1 - $\tau$) - $\Delta$NFA - $\Delta$NWC

- *NOPAT =  EBIT (1 - $\tau$) ?*

 Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) = FCFF - IX (1 - $\tau$) + $\Delta$Debt



**Equity Value of the Company**

Equity Value = Firm Value - Debt Value



*Dividends Discount Model*?



$k_E$ is the cost of equity capital

â€‹	"The rate that you should demand"

${WAAC}$ or $k$ is the total cost of capital



**Zero Dividends Growth**
$$
E = DIV \sum_{i} \frac 1 {(1 + k_E)^i} \approx \frac {DIV} {k_E}
$$
**Constant Dividends Growth**
$$
E = \frac {DIV} {k_E - g_{DIV}}
$$

- $g_{DIV}$ Dividend growth rate
- $k_E$ Discount rate
  - Poor approximation as they approach each other



**Rate Cost of Equity**
$$
k_E = \frac {DIV} E + k_{DIV}
$$
**Two Period Growth**
$$
E_H = \frac {{DIV}_{H + 1}} {k_E - g_2}
$$

- Add initial contribution until $H$ at growth rate $g_1$



## Multiples

Multiple = Metric A / Metric B

- Similar to ratio analysis
  - *Coverage Ratio = EBIT / IX*

**Estimation for Valuation**

- Enterprise Value / EBITDA
- Enterprise Value / Revenue
- Market Equity / Net Profit
- Share Price / Earnings per Share

**Benchmark / Forward PE Ratio**
$$
p_t = pe\;ratio * eps_{t + 1}
$$

- Benchmark PE ratio is often an industry average or based on a company's own historical values

- $PE$ is the Price/ Earnings ratio for a share or firm
  - Share Basis: $\frac {p_0} {e_1}$
    - Current Price / *Expected* Earnings
  - Firm Basis: $\frac {E_0} {NP}_1$
    - Current Equity / *Expected* Net Profit

**Estimation of Equity Value in Year *N***
$$
E_N = PE_N * NP_{N + 1}
$$
