# Financial Statements

### Accounting Principles

Matching Principle (Accrual Accounting)

Monetary Unit Assumption

## Cash Flow

Income Tax Expense

- Income tax paid in cash
- Change in income tax payable
- Change in deferred tax



*Differences in finance income statements*

- EBITDA: essentially the earning power of the company
- EBT...

*Cost is directly related to product while expense is ancillary*



Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

Net Working Capital: Working Capital net of cash and short term debt



Net Profit = (EBIT - Income Expense) * (1 - Tax Rate)

NOPAT = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate)

## Taxes

Corporate tax rate: 21%

Standard Deduction and Personal Exemption

Itemized Deductions: items allowed to be counted for deductions

### Capital Gain Tax

### Dividend Tax Rate

- Ordinary dividends taxed at personal rate
- Qualified dividends taxed at capital gains rate

### Gift Tax

- Give up to $15,000 a year without income tax
- Spouse can give up to $155,000 per year without income tax

### Corporate Federal Income Tax

- Social security
  - There is *no* social security fund, it is payed out of the general tax fund

### Federal Sales Tax

### Retirement

401k: tax deferred, defined contribution plan







Working Capital = CE + AR + INV - AP - ITP - STD

- Current Assets - Current Liabilities

Net Working Capital = AR + INV - AP - ITP

Net Profit = (EBIT - IX) * (1 - t)

NOPAT = EBIT (1- t) + delta Deferred Taxes

Gross Fixed Assets

- Change = Capital Expenditures - Cost of Gross Fixed Assets

Net Fixed Assets

- Change = Capital Expenditure - Depreciate Expense - Carrying Cost of Assets Sold Off

Invested Capital = Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Assets



### Lecture

Value of a Company = SUM[ Future Free Cash Flow / (1 + k)^t ]

- Market value of the debt + equity

*No change in deferred taxes and sell only fully depreciated assets*

FCF = EBIT * (1 - t) + DX -CX - delta NWC

*Steady state investment*

*If DX = CX and delta NWC = 0*

FCF = EBIT (1 - t)



FCF = NOPAT - delta IC

*Assumes that delta IC is value enhancing (Return Rate on Invested Capital > k)*



*Free cash flow is cash flow in excess of required cash to fund all positive net present values.*



## Formulas

Net Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

Cash Flow from Assets = Cash Flow to Stockholders + Cash Flow to Creditors



Operating Cash Flow = EBIT + Depreciation - Taxes

Capital Spending = Ending Net Fixed Assets - Beginning Net Fixed Assets + Depreciation

Change in NWC (Net Working Capital) = Beginning NWC - Ending NWC



Cash Flow from Assets = Operating Cash Flow - Net Capital Spending - Change in NWC



Cash Flow to Creditors = Interest Paid - Net New Borrowing

cash Flow to Stockholders = Dividends Paid - Net New Equity Raised
