# Net Present Value and Other Investment Criteria

## Net Present Value

$$
NPV = PV + C_0
$$

### **Discounted Payback Period Criterion**

$$
0 = \sum_{i=0}^{m} \frac {C_i} {(1 + k)^i}
$$

- $m$ is the periods to achieve a net-zero result

Advantages

- Includes time value of money
- Does not accept negative estimated NPV investments when all future cash flows are positive
- Biased toward liquidity

Disadvantages

- May reject positive NPV investments
- Requires arbitrary cutoff point
  - Ignores cash flow beyond cutoff point
- Biased against long-term projects



### **Payback Period Criterion**

$$
0 = \sum_{i = 0}^{m} C_i
$$

- $m$ is the periods to achieve a net-zero result

Advantages

- Easy to understand
- Adjusts for uncertainty of later cash flows
- Biased toward liquidity

Disadvantages

- Ignores time value of money
- Requires arbitrary cutoff point
- Ignores cash flows beyond cutoff date
- Biased against long-term projects



### **Internal Rate of Return**

$$
0 = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac {C_i} {(1 + {IRR})^i}
$$

Advantages

- Simple to communicate
- If high enough, may not need to estimate a required return



### Mutually Exclusive Projects

- Project with higher NPV
- Project with higher IRR

**Conflicts**

- NPV directly measures the increase in value
- Whenever there is a conflict, you should use NPV
- IRR is unreliable with...
  - Nonconventional cash flows
  - Mutually exclusive projects
