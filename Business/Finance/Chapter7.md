# Interest Rates and Bond Valuation

Notes: Secured against some collateral

- Usually 10 years or less

Bonds (Debentures): Unsecured

- Often more than 10 years

### Bond Ratings

- Moody's and S&P

**Investment** **Quality**

High Grade

- Aaa or AAA: Extremely strong capacity to pay
- Aa or AA: Very strong capacity to pay

Medium Grade

- A or A: Strong but more susceptible to changes in circumstances
- Baa or BBB: Capacity to pay is adequate, adverse conditions will have more impact

### Bond Markets

- Dealer market

- Over the counter transactions
- Extremely large number of bond issues but generally low daily volume in single issues
  - Getting up-to-date prices is difficult

**Debt vs Equity**

Debt

- Not an ownership interest
- No voting rights
- Interest is a cost of doing business and tax deductible
- Legal recourse if interest or principal payments are missed
- Excess debt can lead to financial distress and bankruptcy

Equity

- Ownership interest
- Common stockholders vote for the board of directors and other issues
- Dividends not cost of business and not tax deductible
- Dividends are not a liability of the firm and stockholders have no legal recourse if dividends not paid
- All-equity firms cannot go bankrupt

### Bond Formulas

**Yield to Maturity**
$$
P = \frac C y * (1 - \frac 1 {(1 + y)^N}) + \frac F {(1 + y)^N}
$$

- $y$ is the discount rate that sets the right and left hand sides equal
  - Rate of return that the bond investor will realize from both interest payments and price appreciation
  - Assumes the bond is held to maturity and the interest payments are reinvested immediately at rate $y$

Clean Price: Quoted price

Dirty Price: Price actually paid, computed by bond formulas

- Quoted price + Accrued interest

### Interest Rate Risk

Price Risk

- Change in price due to changes in market interest rates
  - Long-term bonds have more price risk
  - Low coupon rate bonds have more price risk

Reinvestment Rate Risk

- Uncertainty concerning rates at which coupon rates can be reinvested
  - Short-term bonds have more reinvestment rate risk
  - High coupon rate bonds have more reinvestment rate risk

**Modified Duration**
$$
D ^ \star = \frac 1 P (
\frac {dP} {dY})
$$

$$
\Delta P = -PD^* \Delta y
$$

**Duration**
$$
w_i=
\frac {CFi}
{{Pâ‹… ( 1 + y )}^
i}
$$

$$
D=\sum_{i=1}^{N} iw_i
$$

$$
D^*=\frac 1 {1 + y}D
$$



### Inflation

**Fisher Effect**
$$
(1 + r)=\frac {1 + n}{1+i}
$$

$$
r \approx n - i
$$



- $r$ Real interest rate
- $n$ Nominal interest rate
- $i$ Inflation rate



**Zero Coupon Bonds**

- *Zeroes, deep discount bonds, original issue discount bonds*

- Make no periodic interest payments
  - Coupon rate = 0%
  - Yield-to-maturity comes only from the difference between purchase price and the par value
  - *Cannot* sell for more than par value

$$
P = \frac F{(1 + \frac z m)^{mN}}
$$
