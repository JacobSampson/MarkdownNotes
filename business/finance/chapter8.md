## Stock Valuation

**Cash Flows for Stockholders**

* Dividends
  * Dividend income
* Sell shares
  * Capital gains income

Firm Value = Debt Value + Equity Value

* _Market value is usually not radically different from the book value_

**Cash Flows to Equity**

Dividends = \(1 - b\) NP

Free Cash Flow to Firm \(FCFF\) = EBIT \(1 - $\tau$\) - $\Delta$NFA - $\Delta$NWC

* _NOPAT = EBIT \(1 - $\tau$\) ?_

  Free Cash Flow to Equity \(FCFE\) = FCFF - IX \(1 - $\tau$\) + $\Delta$Debt

**Equity Value of the Company**

Equity Value = Firm Value - Debt Value

_Dividends Discount Model_?

$k\_E$ is the cost of equity capital

â€‹ "The rate that you should demand"

${WAAC}$ or $k$ is the total cost of capital

**Zero Dividends Growth**

$$
E = DIV \sum_{i} \frac 1 {(1 + k_E)^i} \approx \frac {DIV} {k_E}
$$

**Constant Dividends Growth**

$$
E = \frac {DIV} {k_E - g_{DIV}}
$$

* $g\_{DIV}$ Dividend growth rate
* $k\_E$ Discount rate
  * Poor approximation as they approach each other

**Rate Cost of Equity**

$$
k_E = \frac {DIV} E + k_{DIV}
$$

**Two Period Growth**

$$
E_H = \frac {{DIV}_{H + 1}} {k_E - g_2}
$$

* Add initial contribution until $H$ at growth rate $g\_1$

### Multiples

Multiple = Metric A / Metric B

* Similar to ratio analysis
  * _Coverage Ratio = EBIT / IX_

**Estimation for Valuation**

* Enterprise Value / EBITDA
* Enterprise Value / Revenue
* Market Equity / Net Profit
* Share Price / Earnings per Share

**Benchmark / Forward PE Ratio**

$$
p_t = pe\;ratio * eps_{t + 1}
$$

* Benchmark PE ratio is often an industry average or based on a company's own historical values
* $PE$ is the Price/ Earnings ratio for a share or firm
  * Share Basis: $\frac {p\_0} {e\_1}$
    * Current Price / _Expected_ Earnings
  * Firm Basis: $\frac {E\_0} {NP}\_1$
    * Current Equity / _Expected_ Net Profit

**Estimation of Equity Value in Year** _**N**_

$$
E_N = PE_N * NP_{N + 1}
$$

#### Common Stock

Features

* Voting rights
* Proxy voting
  * Can assign voting rights to third party
* Classes of stock
* Other rights
  * Share proportionally in declared dividends
  * Share proportionally in remaining assets during liquidation

#### Dividends

* Not a liability until a dividends has been _declared_ by the board
  * Firm cannot go bankrupt for not declaring dividends
* Not a business expense so not tax deductible
* Taxation of dividends received by individuals depends on the holding period
  * Dividends received by corporations have a minimum 70% exclusion from taxable income

**Dividends Income Tax for Individuals**

* Qualified dividends: Capital gains rate
  * US company common and preferred
  * IRS approved
    * Non-interest income
    * No REITs or MLPs
  * Holding period
* Ordinary: Personal income rate

#### Preferred Stock

* Dividends
  * Stated dividends that must be paid before dividends can be paid to common stockholders
  * Not a liability of the firm and preferred dividends can be deferred indefinitely
  * Most are cumulative
    * Any missed have to be paid before common dividends can be paid
* Generally does not carry voting rights
